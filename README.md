- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sanidhya-02
- 👀 I’m interested in App Dev (well Back end mostly), cloud computing and lowkey fw ML sometimes (not a fan tho)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VCS and .NET frameworks along with Java sometimes just to keep my Java lover alive, some documentation/lectures on new topics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involved in developing and learning new stuff
- 📫 How to reach me : just drop a mail on sanidhya0201@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: the egg came 150 million years ago before the f-ing chicken
